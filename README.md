# budget-app-js
Allows you to calculate your budget from anywhere.
## Improvements
* Styling can be improved

## How does this work?
Enter the required values in each text field. Once you click the "calculate" button, your budget is being updated. 

You should see that more rows gets added to the table the more expenses you add to your budget. From this table, you can delete the expense. You should also see a list with 10 possible categories used with the total spent on each category.
